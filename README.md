Xevious for MEGA65
==================

Xevious (1982):


Xevious is considered one of the pioneering titles in the vertical-scrolling shooter genre. The game features a unique blend of both air and ground combat, distinguishing it from many other shooters of its time. Players control the Solvalou, a futuristic aircraft, and must navigate through hostile airspace, destroying both aerial and ground-based enemies.

Key features and elements of Xevious include:

Dual Attack: The Solvalou can fire both a forward-firing blaster for air targets and bombs for ground targets, allowing players to engage enemies from multiple directions.

Varied Enemy Types: The game features a wide range of enemy aircraft, ground-based installations, and bosses, each with its own attack patterns and behaviors.

Terrain Interaction: Players must pay attention to both the aerial and ground elements of the game, as enemy installations on the ground can pose threats, and the landscape can be used for cover.

Power-Ups: Power-ups can be collected to enhance the Solvalou's capabilities and firepower.

Super Xevious (1984):

Super Xevious is an enhanced version of the original Xevious, featuring improved gameplay elements. It retains the core gameplay of its predecessor but adds new features and challenges.

Both games are known for their engaging and fast-paced gameplay, as well as their contribution to the shoot 'em up genre. Porting these classics to an FPGA platform would provide nostalgic gaming experiences for enthusiasts and preserve the legacy of these iconic titles.

This core is based on the
[MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Arcade-Xevious_MiSTer)
Xevious core which
itself is based on the work of [many others](AUTHORS).

[Muse aka sho3string](https://github.com/sho3string)
ported the core to the MEGA65 in 2023.

The core uses the [MiSTer2MEGA65](https://github.com/sy2002/MiSTer2MEGA65)
framework and [QNICE-FPGA](https://github.com/sy2002/QNICE-FPGA) for
FAT32 support (loading ROMs, mounting disks) and for the
on-screen-menu.
